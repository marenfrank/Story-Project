		Way was working as an intern for Cartoon Network in New York City during the September 11, 2001 attacks.
		Seeing the effects of the attacks first-hand prompted Way to change his views on life in the following weeks.
		He told Spin magazine, "I literally said to myself, 'Fuck art. I've gotta get out of the basement. I've gotta see the world.
		I've gotta make a difference.'" To help deal with the emotional effects the attacks had on him, Way wrote the lyrics to the song
		"Skylines and Turnstiles", which became the first song by My Chemical Romance.

		in Japan. He arranged much of the instrumentation of the band's original track "Sing" to create a sound that
		emulated traditional Japanese music.
