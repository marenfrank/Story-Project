		<p class="b">
			<i>I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love</i> is their first studio album released on July 23, 2002 by Eyeball Records.
			It is often regarded as a concept album. It involves two Bonnie and Clyde-esque characters who are eventually gunned down in the desert.

			house and sucking your blood."<br>

	<h2 class="talbum"> Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</h2>

		<p class="t">
			<i>Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge</i> is their second studio album,
			released on June 8, 2004 by Reprise Records.Gerard Way, the lead singer of the band, who also designed its artwork,
			has described the album as a "pseudo-conceptual horror story", stating that it is "the story of a
			man and a woman who are separated by death in a gunfight and he goes to hell only to realize by the
			devil telling him that she's still alive. The devil says he can be with her again if he brings the devil the
			souls of a thousand evil men and the man agrees to do it, and so the devil hands him a gun.
			That was the idea behind the concept, the record ended up being much more about loss and real life than anything,
			so I would say it's a good split."<br>

	<h2 class="palbum"> The Black Parade</h2>

		<p class="p">
			<i>The Black Parade</i> is their third studio album, released on October 23, 2006, through Reprise Records.
			It's a rock opera centering around the character of "The Patient". It is about his passage out of life and the memories he has of it.
			"The Patient" dies and death comes for him in the form of a parade. This is based on singer Gerard Way's
			notion of death appearing to a person in the form of their fondest memory, in this case seeing a parade as a child.
			The album also saw the creation of the alter-ego band, The Black Parade.<br>

	<h2 class="dalbum"> Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</h2>

		<p class="d">
			<i>Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys</i> (often referred to as simply <i>Danger Days</i>) is their
			fourth and final studio album, released on November 22, 2010, by Reprise Records.The album's concept is based around the lives of the
			"Killjoys", a group of rebellious rogues living in a post-apocalyptic California, in the year 2019 (a reference to the film <i>Blade Runner</i>).
			Promotional websites for the album reference the alleged 2012 doomsday prediction as a possible cause of the fictional catastrophe.
			Like many concept records, the band members are in character, in the case of this album, as their "Killjoy" alter-egos:
			"Party Poison" (Gerard Way), "Jet-Star" (Ray Toro), "Fun Ghoul" (Frank Iero), and "The Kobra Kid" (Mikey Way), which can be seen in music videos.
			The Killjoys are a group of outlaws who are fighting against the evil corporation Better Living Industries (BL/ind.) and its various "Draculoids"
			and executors, such as Korse (Grant Morrison).<br>
